What Bentso has to do:

c: country
y: year
h: time period (hours, days, weeks, month)
t: technology


Consumption per country, year and hour can be calculated with the following equation:


Cons_{c,y,h} = Gen_{c,y,h} + Imp_{c,y,h} - Exp_{c,y,h} - StoCons_{c,y,h}

where:

Gen_{c,y,h} can be obtained from ENTSO-e

Imp_{c,y,h} can be obtained from ENTSO-e

Exp_{c,y,h} can be obtained from ENTSO-e

StoCons_{c,y,h} has to be estimated



If we have the above data then we can calculate the generation and consumption by technology:

GenTech_{c,y,h,t} can be obtained from ENTSO-e

ExpTech_{c,y,h,t} = Exp_{c,y,h} GenTech_{c,y,h,t}/Gen_{c,y,h}



ImpFromCountry_{c,y,h,i} we have to chack if this can be obtained from ENTSO-e

ImpTechFromCountry_{c,y,h,i,t} = ImpFromCountry_{c,y,h,i} ExpTech_{i,y,h,t}/Exp_{i,y,h}  in this case 

StoConsTech_{c,y,h,t} Needs to be estimated


Only if everything above has been obatined or calculated, then consumption can be estimated.

Cons_{c,y,h} = \sum_t \left ( GenTech_{c,y,h,t} - \left ( ExpTech_{c,y,h,t} + StoConsTech_{c,y,h,t}  \right ) + \sum_i ImpTechFromCountry_{c,y,h,i,t} \right )
